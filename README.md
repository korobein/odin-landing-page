## Landin Page Project

This was my frist time trying coding a web page, and I surely made a lot of mistakes. It was basically trial and error: playing around with the amount of padding, margin and gap between every section until I got all in place. I couldn't make the quote text as thin as in the example, dispite not having found any rule overriding "font-weight". Or maybe it's just my browser. And the use of "class" and "id", in some cases, seems to follow no logic... but it worked! I don't know, i'm just a noob for now.
